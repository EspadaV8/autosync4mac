A git clone of autosync4mac from http://code.google.com/p/autosync4mac/

A very hacky attempt by me to try and get bi-directional syncing working (using rsync)


To get this working in OS X I needed to install the following;

Gems:
	net-ssh
	net-scp
	ruby-growl
	fsevents

RubyCocoa:
	wget http://transact.dl.sourceforge.net/project/rubycocoa/RubyCocoa/1.0.1/RubyCocoa-1.0.1.tar.gz
	tar xf RubyCocoa-1.0.1.tar.gz
	cd RubyCocoa-1.0.1
	ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386 -arch x86_64'
	ruby install.rb config
	ruby install.rb setup
	sudo ruby install.rb install
